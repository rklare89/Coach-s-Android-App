<h1><strong>Coaching Companion</strong></h1>

<p>This application is a personal project for youth baseball/softball coaches.</p>

<p>As a youth sports coach, keeping up with emergency contact information for parents can be tedious, especially when kids are raised by people other than their parents.  This application is initially developed to keep player contact information quick to access.  
future updates will aim to add general team management functionality.  </p>

<p>This project is currently in testing status on the Google Play Store.</p>
